# Todos

Todos is a full-stack, mobile-first web application to help people with accessibility needs and their support workers plan fun days out in Scotland.

This was a Capstone Project completed at the end of a 16 week intensive Professional Software Development Course at [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/).

## The Brief

The Glasgow branch of ENABLE have approached you to create a mobile application for their care support workers to find local activities to take part in with the individuals they support.

#### For the MVP, the user should be able to:

-See a list of attractions

-Add/edit an attraction

-Can click on an attraction to see more information

-filter attractions based on needs of the individual

#### Possible extensions:

-user can create a favourites list

-user can leave comments and pictures(save image as blob?)

-user can leave star rating

-user login


#### Advanced extensions:

-use api to order attractions by postcode

-update for desktop use

## Installation

Open the server folder in IntelliJ to run the 'AttractionsApplication' file.

In the client folder, install the packages and run the React app.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

At the moment the log in screen will accept any username and password to demonstrate functionality but we are planning to implement user authentication in a future sprint.
